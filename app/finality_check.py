"""Base transaction finality check — real data only, no modeled probabilities.

Answers a different question than the other two Base products in this repo:
Pulse is a network snapshot, /base/tx-decision is a pre-submit fee/timing
call. This is post-submit: "I already sent this transaction — is it safe to
treat as irreversible yet?"

The OP-stack (Base's execution client) exposes its own consensus-safety
block tags over standard JSON-RPC: `eth_getBlockByNumber("safe"/"finalized",
false)`. Those come from L1-derived finality, not a guess — "safe" tracks
L1 attestation, "finalized" tracks L1 finality (~2 epochs). Comparing a
transaction's block against those tags is a real classification read off
the chain, not an invented reorg-probability number.
