# x402-mcp project changes (isolated scope)

This file documents deltas **only** within this repository (`x402-mcp/`).
If this clone sits inside a larger parent workspace, use this manifest for goal
verification instead of a repo-wide `git status` of the parent tree.

## Application (`app/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | FastAPI: `/health`, `/.well-known/mcp`, `/upgrade`, `/quota/{id}`, MCP mount |
| `mcp_server.py` | 10 MCP tools, preemptive quota via `_execute_tool(resolved)` |
| `x402_services.py` | x402 SDK buyer/seller flows, verify+settle revenue paths |
| `commerce.py` | Tiers, quota, rate limits, tool credits, meta envelope |
| `config.py` | Env-based settings (wallet, facilitator, tier prices) |
| `models.py` | Pydantic tool I/O + `ResponseMeta` |
| `manifest.py` | `/.well-known/mcp` tier + tool catalog |

## Tests (`tests/`)

- `test_commerce.py` — quota, 429, credits, meta
- `test_manifest.py` — HTTP endpoints including `/upgrade`
- `test_mcp_tools.py` — MCP wrapper, agent_id consistency, pro activation
- `test_mcp_stdio.py` — stdio `call_tool` transport for 4 tools
- `test_x402_services.py` — discovery, probe, wallet guard
- `test_pay_and_fetch_e2e.py` — mocked pay-and-fetch E2E

## Scripts & docs

- `scripts/verify_goal.py` — verification plan evidence capture
- `scripts/vercel_connect_token.py` — Vercel Connect token for the `huggingface.co/x402-mcp` MCP connector (OIDC env or CLI fallback), `--verify` smoke-tests tools/list
- `scripts/seed_purchase.py` — one-shot $0.01 seed buy mirroring `roles.py::treasurer_buy` (sole spender `x402_services.pay_and_fetch` with a hard `max_price_usdc` cap → `ledger_writer.record_spend`); default target is the proven Tavily x402 search endpoint on Base mainnet
- `run_stdio.py` — MCP stdio entry
- `docs/runbook.md`, `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/swarm/PROFIT_ORCHESTRATOR.md` — operator-supplied profitability swarm spec v1.0 (2026-07-16)

## Swarm pipeline fixes (2026-07-16)

- `app/x402_services.py::parse_amount_atomic` — tolerant Bazaar `accepts[].amount` parsing (decimal-USDC strings like `"0.016"` no longer crash discovery); used by the discovery price filter and `roles.py::_parse_accepts`
- `app/swarm/roles.py::treasurer_buy` — POST fallback on 404/405 (no 402 challenge issued, so nothing paid twice); unlocked the first fully settled buy→compose→list cycles
- `app/config.py` — Pulse list price $8.00 → $0.25 (operator-approved reprice toward the ~$0.30 ecosystem average per call)

## Bazaar discoverability + durable quota (2026-07-16)

- Bazaar discovery extension on served 402 challenges: `build_seller_requirements` embeds `resource` info + `extensions.bazaar` (SDK `declare_discovery_extension` with the required `method` injected — the SDK helper alone emits an invalid extension outside its server wrapper) so a settled payment through the CDP facilitator catalogs the endpoint; threaded through composite (`merchant_list`) and Pulse (`publish_pulse_product`) listings via `app/swarm/models.py::purchase_discovery_metadata`; config knobs `BAZAAR_DISCOVERABLE` / `BAZAAR_SERVICE_NAME` / `BAZAAR_SERVICE_TAGS`; tests in `tests/test_discovery_extension.py`
- Revenue-network coherence guard: `resolve_revenue_network()` (explicit `REVENUE_NETWORK` > first CDP network when creds set > default) used by pro-tier and tool-credit builders; `/doctor` FAILS when a public deploy with a receive wallet would serve testnet revenue challenges; tests in `tests/test_revenue_network.py`
- `docs/DEPLOY-PLAN.md` + root `fly.toml` — seller-only public storefront deploy plan (Fly.io + Upstash Redis) ending in the one discoverable settle that triggers Bazaar cataloging
- `RedisQuotaStore` (`app/commerce.py::build_quota_store`): REDIS_URL set + reachable → Redis-backed tier/credits/monthly-quota/Stripe-idempotency persistence; unreachable → loud fallback with reason; `/doctor` and `/stats` now report the ACTUAL live store mode, never the env var; deps `redis>=5` (+ `fakeredis` for tests); tests in `tests/test_redis_quota.py` and dual-backend `tests/test_commerce.py`

## Revenue paths (criteria 3)

1. **Pro tier** — `get_pro_upgrade_requirements` → pay → `activate_pro_tier` (verify + settle)
2. **Per-use credits** — `get_tool_credits_requirements` → pay → `purchase_tool_credits` (verify + settle); credits consumed when monthly quota exceeded
3. **HTTP upgrade** — `GET /upgrade` documents payment flow (no 404)

## 2026-07-10 — hermetic tests + operator dashboard

- **Fixed all 17 failing tests** (root cause: `x402` SDK not installed in the active env → `pip install -e ".[dev]"`).
- **Hermetic test backend** (`tests/conftest.py`): session-scoped mock x402 facilitator (`/facilitator/supported`) + CDP discovery (`/discovery/resources`) on localhost. Wired via `X402_FACILITATOR_URL`/`CDP_DISCOVERY_URL` env vars (inherited by stdio subprocess tests) and by patching the in-process `settings` singleton. `X402_LIVE_TESTS=1` bypasses the mock.
- `test_get_payment_requirements_public_url` now uses the local `probe_402_url` fixture instead of httpbin.org.
- **Operator dashboard** (`app/dashboard.py`, route `GET /dashboard`, `/` redirects there): fintech-terminal UI polling `/health`, `/quota/{agent}`, `/.well-known/mcp`, `/upgrade` every 5s. Block-character quota meters, 10-tool matrix, revenue paths, live event tape. Inline CSS/JS, no build step.
- New `tests/test_dashboard.py` (4 tests) keeps the UI under test discipline.
- Result: **54 passed, 0 failed** (20 evidence tests skip by design until `capture_goal_evidence` artifacts exist).

## 2026-07-18 — QMA(2) dual-witness verification ("Arthur & the Merlins")

- `app/swarm/qma.py` — QMA(2)-inspired verification layer for the swarm. A lead
  verifier ("Arthur") cross-checks two ISOLATED specialist witnesses ("Merlin-1"
  Optimistic Explorer, "Merlin-2" Skeptical Auditor) that never share context.
  Deterministic, inspectable core (data-honesty convention): clusters critical
  claims, computes an **agreement ratio** over the union of critical elements,
  an **entanglement score** (0–100; high = suspiciously copied wording, dampens
  confidence + warns), detects contradictions (contested groups), runs pluggable
  soundness validators, and synthesises a merged solution with a confidence
  score, run-derived KPIs (risk-reduction figure is MODELLED with its assumption
  stated), validation steps ("edges"), and a rollback plan. Accepts only on
  ≥80% completeness AND soundness; else iterates (fresh isolated witnesses) up to
  `max_rounds`. Witness production is a pluggable `WitnessProducer`; a thin
  `llm_witness_producer` (temp 0.1, isolated prompts) keeps the LLM/network
  dependency out of the deterministic core.
- `tests/test_qma.py` (10 tests) — agreement/accept, contradiction→reject,
  low-completeness→iterate, high-entanglement penalty, validator soundness,
  computed KPIs, async producer, isolation + exactly-two-Merlin enforcement.

## 2026-07-18 — CDP description-limit safeguard

- `app/x402_services.py::_clamp_description` (+ `CDP_MAX_DESCRIPTION_CHARS=500`)
  clamps the resource description centrally in `build_seller_requirements`, on
  every CDP-facing path (`ResourceConfig.description`, `PaymentRequired.error`,
  and `ResourceInfo.description`). Prompted by paid discoverability intel: the
  CDP Facilitator rejects BOTH verify and settle when a description exceeds 500
  chars, which would silently break discovery AND revenue. The composite
  listing's description embeds a user-supplied `topic`, the one unbounded path.
  Tests in `tests/test_discovery_extension.py` (clamp + short-passthrough).

## 2026-07-18 — semantically dense served descriptions (retrieval optimization)

- Enriched the resource descriptions CDP Bazaar semantic search indexes, leading
  with what each endpoint does + inputs + output shape using concrete nouns an
  agent would query (truthful, computed-from-real-sources; now safe under the
  500-char clamp): Pulse (`app/swarm/publisher.py`) = Base mainnet settlement
  intelligence for pricing x402/USDC micropayments (block, gas/base+priority
  fee, ETH price, ETH & ERC-20/USDC transfer settlement cost, JSON/GET);
  composite (`app/swarm/roles.py`) = x402-sourced cited Markdown research report
  synthesized from N paid upstream sources; `mn_compliance` = Minneapolis
  rental-license compliance by street address, JSON output.
